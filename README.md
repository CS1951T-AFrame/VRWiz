# VRWiz

Collaborative multiplayer VR client and server framework for data visualization powered by A-Frame and Socket.IO.

This open-source project was build by [CS1951T](https://www.vrwiki.cs.brown.edu/) students at Brown University in Providence. We use [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) for the frontend and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for the backend. The project also utilizes [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
